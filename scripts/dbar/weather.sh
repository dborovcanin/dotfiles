# The weather, for a dbar `command` module.
#
# dbar has no weather collector and is not going to grow one: the weather is a web
# service rather than something /proc knows, and fetching it is a script's job. This is
# that script - it prints one line of tab-separated `key=value` pairs per place, which is
# the whole of what a command module's side of the protocol is. With `pages = true` the
# module holds one reading per line and the wheel scrolls between them, so three cities
# cost one fetch and one module.
#
# The knobs come from the module's `params`, in the order it wrote them, so moving city
# or swapping units is a line in the config rather than an edit here:
#
#   $1     units: metric or imperial
#   $2     an OpenWeatherMap API key, or the path to a file holding one
#   $3...  where: one or more "latitude,longitude", a page each
#
# The places come last because they are the part that grows. A key kept in a file rather
# than in the config is the point of accepting both: a dotfile that goes into a git
# repository should not be carrying a credential.
#
# Needs `curl` and `jq`. Both endpoints used here are on OpenWeatherMap's free tier.
