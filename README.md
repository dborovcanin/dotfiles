ZSH config

This is just some config `.zshrc` file. I use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh "Oh my zsh") with [powerlevel9k](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k "Powerlevel9k") theme. Font is [ner-fonts-complete](https://nerdfonts.com "Nerd Fonts") and color scheme is `Solarized`.
