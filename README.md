ZSH and Tmux config

This is my conifg for `zsh` and `tmux`. Repo contains config files and themes. I use [vanilla zsh](http://www.zsh.org) with [powerlevel9k](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k) theme. Font is [nerd-fonts-complete](https://nerdfonts.com "Nerd Fonts") and color scheme is `Solarized dark`. This config is highly inspired by [this one](https://github.com/mijicd/dotfiles).
